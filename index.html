        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p class="quote" style="margin-bottom: 10px;">"Fill the gaps, stay liquid!" - Hondo</p>
        <p>A professor I had in college instilled in me the importance of mastering fundamentals over chasing the latest fancy framework. I'll admit that I don't know React. But why should I? I've never needed it for my work. Technologies evolve rapidly in this industry, but by focusing on fundamentals like vanilla JS, Python, C++, and Git, I build a solid foundation and remain adaptable. Mastering the basics ensures that learning new technologies and tech stacks becomes a more natural and seamless process, ultimately making me a more versatile and effective engineer.</p>
        <h3>Why Software Engineering?</h3>
        <p class="quote" style="margin-bottom: 10px;">"Words are, in my not-so-humble opinion, our most inexhaustible source of magic" - Albus Dumbledore</p>
        <p>Software engineering allows me to combine my analytical skills with creativity. I love the challenge of finding efficient and elegant solutions to problems, and the satisfaction that comes from seeing my code come to life.</p>
        <h3>Other things that make me happy</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <h4>Basketball</h4>
            <p>I've been playing basketball since I was 8, continuing through childhood and into high school and college. I have a deep understanding of the game, having played, refereed, coached, and ran the scorer's table. MJ who? LeBron's my GOAT #JamesGang</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <h4>Food</h4>
            <p>I absolutely love prime rib and steak, they're my all-time favorite foods. I'm also always excited to explore new dining spots wherever I go. I'm shameless when it comes to free foodâ€”I'll show up anywhere offering food on the house!</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <h4>Harry Potter</h4>
            <p>I'm a child at heart, and Harry Potter brings out the kid in me. I'm known for my prowess in Harry Potter trivia and am still working on mastering the art of Apparition!</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <h4>TV Shows</h4>
            <p>I enjoy binge-watching a variety of TV shows, especially those that are thought-provoking and emotionally engaging. My favorite shows include The Boys, SWAT, Suits, and The Office. You'll even find Easter eggs from my favorite shows hidden around my website.</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <h4>Biking</h4>
            <p>Spending an entire summer biking to and from work in Portland made me realize my passion for biking. During that time, I mastered riding without hands and discovered the joy of exploring Biketown on two wheels!</p>
