          Designing this website from scratch was a lot of fun. 
          I am a huge fan of dark mode and grayscale so I decided to use that color scheme for my site.
          I also made every logo and graphic on this site because graphic design too is fun to me.
          This project has helped me practice my HTML & CSS skills and now serves as a portfolio for my other projects.
