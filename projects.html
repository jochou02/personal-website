            <div class="description">
              <p>I originally created this website in the summer of 2022 when I was first learning JavaScript/HTML/CSS. Crafting the site from the ground up was a hands-on, rewarding way to develop my frontend web development skills.</p>
              <p>The website you see today is not the first iteration, but an evolved versionâ€”reimagined and redesigned from the original. While the first version holds a special place as the starting point of my journey, it is now deprecated, having paved the way for the enhanced and refined iteration you currently see.</p>
              <p>The new rendition pays homage to the original design in some aspects, maintaining the essence of its predecessor. However, significant portions have been entirely overhauled to create a more refined and improved user experience. While I've preserved certain elements that echo the site's original spirit, other areas have undergone a comprehensive transformation to improve their function and aesthetic appeal. This vibrant fusion of old and new encapsulates my ongoing journey of learning and growth in web development.</p>
