I originally created this website in the summer of 2022 when I was first learning JavaScript/HTML/CSS. Crafting the site from the ground up was a hands-on, rewarding way to develop my frontend web development skills.

The website you see today is not the first iteration, but an evolved versionâ€”reimagined and redesigned from the original. While the first version holds a special place as the starting point of my journey, it is now deprecated, having paved the way for the enhanced and refined iteration you currently see.

The new rendition pays homage to the original design in some aspects, maintaining the essence of its predecessor. However, significant portions have been entirely overhauled to create a more refined and improved user experience. While I've preserved certain elements that echo the site's original spirit, other areas have undergone a comprehensive transformation to improve their function and aesthetic appeal. This vibrant fusion of old and new encapsulates my ongoing journey of learning and growth in web development.
